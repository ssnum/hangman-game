# Hangman Game

This Hangman game is a simple console-based game where the player tries to guess a hidden word letter by letter. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. I made this game as a learning project for Python and working with external libraries.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `script.py` file to start the game.

## How to Play

1. The game will select a random word for you to guess.
2. Guess a letter of the word by typing it in and pressing Enter.
3. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
4. If the letter is incorrect, you will lose an attempt.
5. You can also guess the entire word at any time.
6. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
